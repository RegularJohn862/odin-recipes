            <li>2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons sweet pickle relish</li>
                
            <li>1/4 cup barbecue sauce</li>
                
            <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>

            Using a rolling pin, roll each bread slice until entirely flat. 
            Trim just the crust off each bread slice, forming a 4x4-inch square. 
            Spread each bread slice with an even layer of mustard (about 3/4 teaspoon per slice).</li>

            Working with 1 slice of bread at a time, place a halved cheese slice on the edge of the bread 
            closest to you; place 1 hot dog horizontally on top of the cheese slice. If needed, trim the ends of 
            the hot dog so that no hot dog extends over edges of bread. Spoon 1 1/2 
            teaspoons onion horizontally across the cheese slice above the hot dog, followed by 1 teaspoon of relish.</li>

            Roll up tightly, applying gentle pressure to help seal the bread seams together. 
            Slice crosswise into 3 equal pieces (about 1 1/4-inches each), and transfer to a serving platter. 
            Repeat process with remaining ingredients. Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) 
            for 5 minutes, or according to manufacturer's instructions. Lightly coat tops and sides of 
            roll-ups with cooking spray. Working in 2 batches, add roll-ups to basket, spacing them 1/2-inch apart, 
            and cook until bread is lightly golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
